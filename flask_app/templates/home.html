      <h1>Dung (Zoom) Nguyen</h1>
      <p>
        I am a passionate developer and problem solver. I love working on projects that challenge me
        and expand my knowledge in software development. My interests include web development,
        algorithms, and building interactive applications.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>I currently attend Michigan State University (MSU) with a major in Computer Science.
        I will be graduating with a bachelor's in May 2025. I initially wanted to be a computer
        programmer because I wanted to build applications and work on cool projects.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>I plan to go into the semiconductor industry and climb the corporate ladder.
        At MSU, I am currently a helper at the Action Lab, working on the NVIDIA Isaac Sim on Omniverse.
